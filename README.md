# Escape-Vape
## About
A free web application targeted towards teens (anonymously) to best stop vape and nicotine addictions by bringing therapies to the digital age in new ways. This application will be submitted to the 2021 Congressional App Challenge!

## Authors
The authors are Joshua Hsueh (VA), Fiona Zheng (VA), and Lukas Hu (NV). We used NodeJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS, EJS templating, BootstrapCSS, and a lot of custom CSS styling. This was the first time for some of our members creating an application of this size. We learned a lot about app development and hope to create more cool apps. Nonetheless, we are excited to present our final version of EscapeVape to the 2021 Congressional App Challenge! Learn more about it below.
